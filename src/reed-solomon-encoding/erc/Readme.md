# Reed solomon implementation

We really tried to find a modern package that has good error correction, however, we were unsuccessful.  
Because of this, we asked an LLM to convert [`erc-js`](https://github.com/louismullie/erc-js).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Initially, we tried to import the github repo, but it's too old.
